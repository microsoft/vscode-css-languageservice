To do this the embedding element needs to list the properties that are to be made available to the image by listing them as values of the -moz-context-properties property, and the image needs to opt in to using those properties by using values such as the context-fill value.\n\nThis feature is available since Firefox 55, but is only currently supported with SVG images loaded via chrome:// or resource:// URLs. To experiment with the feature in SVG on the Web it is necessary to set the svg.context-properties.content.enabled pref to true.`,
